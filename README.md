PURPOSE

To help teacher's organize tasks they need to do depending on the student.

If John has to be tested on his sight word fluency every Tuesday and Thursday, this app will track and remind the user when they log in.
The teacher will enter their class roster, then enter into each student specifically and set up tasks and frequencies. Finally, a database will
save the class. Teachers need only enter credentials (for this mock app, just their name) to access their roster when they log in.

This is meant to give teachers a snapshot of what they need to do each day, to make managing their calander a little bit easier. 

This app, when ready, will be tested with real teacher colleagues and adjusted based on feedback.

TECHNOLOGY

Being developed with Angular/HTML/CSS/Typescript and Java/Spring at the backend.

PROGRESS 

(3/5/24)
The front end is functional, but lacking responsiveness (see next section). I will be working on creating the back end in the coming week.

(3/14/24)
Application is fully functional on my local computer. I will be looking to host and configure it to a website soon.
