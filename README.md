# ClassTaskManager

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

Author: Michael Miller

Purpose: To help teacher's organize tasks they need to do depending on the student.

If John has to be tested on his sight word fluency every Tuesday and Thursday, this app will track and remind the user when they log in.
The teacher will enter their class roster, then enter into each student specifically and set up tasks and frequencies. Finally, a database will
save the class. Teachers need only enter credentials (for this mock app, just their name) to access their roster when they log in.

This is meant to give teachers a snapshot of what they need to do each day, to make managing their calander a little bit easier. 

Technology: Being developed with Angular/HTML/CSS/Typescript and Java/Spring at the backend.

IMPORTANT - AS OF NOW, THIS IS A MOCK APP. PLEASE DO NOT ENTER ACTUAL STUDENT INFORMATION OR ACTUAL LOG-IN CREDENTIALS FROM OTHER SITES.
